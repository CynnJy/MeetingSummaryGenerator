# MeetingSummaryGenerator

The main objective of the Meeting Summary Generator is to summarise the recorded meeting minutes to a short version, ensuring that the meeting participants do not need to encounter the aforementioned issues and may help to improve efficiency. As compared to a normal summarization system, the meeting summary generator is built with an automatic speech recognition which is capable of converting audio to text. In other words, the user will only be required to upload the audio file, and without the need of translating it by themselves. In this system, the summarization model utilises the BART model, a deep learning model that is based on the Sequence-to-sequence model from the Transformer. Encoder used to input the raw text, while Decoder used to predict the text to be generated.
